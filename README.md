# Deep Learning Projects

## BERT-SQUAD LLM
This project leverages the powerful BERT model to tackle question answering tasks, providing insights into the application of transformer models in understanding and processing natural language, with a focus on the SQuAD benchmark.

## GANs
This directory is centered around the exploration and implementation of Generative Adversarial Networks, showcasing two variants: DCGANs for their image generation capabilities and WGANs for improved training stability and quality of generated images.

## Understanding_Fundamentals
A collection of experiments designed to dissect the intricacies of neural network behavior, including the impact of generalization, the role of optimization landscapes (such as flatness of minima), and the significance of model capacity on learning dynamics.

## Video Caption Generation 
An advanced endeavor to bridge video content with natural language through automatic caption generation, combining techniques from both computer vision and sequence modeling to create descriptive textual output for given video inputs using GRU based encoder-decoder.
